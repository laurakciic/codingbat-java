Given an int n, return the absolute difference between n and 21, except return double the absolute difference if n is over 21.


diff21(19) → 2
diff21(10) → 11
diff21(21) → 0


SOLUTION

int remainder;

public int diff21(int n) {
  
  remainder = 21 - n;
  
  return (n > 21) ? remainder*-2 : remainder;
}
